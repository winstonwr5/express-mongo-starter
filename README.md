# Oasitic - Interactive Storytelling App


Hello all! This is a working draft of my second project.

As it stands now, the app is a working CRUD app built primarily around `Express`, `MongoDB`, and `Mongoose`, with a healthy dose of `jQuery` and, especially, `CSS` thrown in.

## Technologies at play


The app has a tested RESTful routes, which are funneled through the "Testimonials" aspect of the app. Users can securely sign up for and log in to the site, after which they can add new entries to the index, giving their tech story a title.

If they want to change something about their story, they can easily access their entry from their entry's show page, where they can also delete their story outright.

## Background, Unsolved Problems, and Considerations for the Future...

'Oasitic' is the working title for this beginner version of an app I actually would like release in tandem with a narrative fiction podcast I'm writing. Among other things, the podcast covers the resource gap that can leave disadvantaged populations behind in tech innovations. This app is meant to be a way for people inspired by the podcast - or just inspired to signal-boost stories of tech innovations that help the aforementioned communities - to collect examples and create a living map that contradicts the "tech gap" narrative.

"Unsolved Problems" weren't a pressing issue for this project as much as "Things Left To Do" In its more production-ready form, I want users to be able to upload videos of innovative tech solutions from their phone, connect in a forum, have access to resources online or in their area, and connect to the podcast. I would love it if the app was features-heavy, but with a very sleek presentation. Speaking of presentation...

## Goal for this project

My overarching goal for this project - beyond the MVP of creating a working, full-stack app - was to really begin to focus on an area in which I've been increasingly interested through the course: UX/UI design. I still have a LOT to learn, but I took a significant step towards that goal by creating a collapsible sidebar menu for my Index Page. Only some of the links are fully functioning, but the sidebar itself was a painstaking stretch goal that I am very happy I accomplished. Beyond that, I really want to refine my UX/UI design and invest more time in color theory and layouts and animations, moving forward.
